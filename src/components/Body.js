          <p>
            My name is Amalia Boomgaard but I have gone by Amy for most of my life.
            I recently graduated UCF's coding bootcamp. When I first began I thought I would lean more towards front-end work only as I enjoy designing and watching my designs come to life through the computer screen.
            However now that I have more experience working with the back-end I realize that it was not as hard as I thought it would be.
            I would like to be a Full Stack Developer, either or, React Developer. I enjoy coding and it has been a life changer.
            I enjoy working with React Framework and Javascript. 
            In my freetime you can find me relaxing with a physical or digital sketchbook in hand and my headphones on drawing away~
